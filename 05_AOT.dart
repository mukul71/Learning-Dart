AOT stands for "Ahead-Of-Time" compilation. It refers to a compilation technique used in programming languages and frameworks, 
including Dart and Flutter. AOT compilation involves converting the source code of a program into machine code or a lower-level 
intermediate representation before the program is executed.

In the context of Dart and Flutter:

Dart AOT Compilation: Dart code can be compiled ahead of time into a more efficient binary format, which can be executed directly by 
the target platform's processor. This helps improve the startup performance of Dart applications because the code is already compiled before
runtime, reducing the need for just-in-time (JIT) compilation during execution.

Flutter AOT Compilation: In the context of Flutter, AOT compilation is used to generate native machine code for the Flutter app's Dart code
and UI framework. This native code can be bundled with the app's assets and executed on the target platform, resulting in improved 
performance and reduced execution time compared to using just-in-time (JIT) compilation.

AOT compilation offers advantages such as faster startup times, reduced memory usage, and improved overall performance, especially for 
production builds of applications. It's particularly beneficial for mobile and web applications where quick startup and efficient execution are crucial.

It's worth noting that while AOT compilation provides these benefits, it also introduces some trade-offs, such as larger binary sizes 
and potentially longer build times due to the compilation process. However, these trade-offs are generally outweighed by the performance 
improvements gained by using AOT compilation, especially for production deployments.
