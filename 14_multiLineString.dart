  lines

  doing this.''';

  // The three ''' signifies that this is a multi linge string. Three double """ will do the same thing. 
  
   //If you just want to use multiple lines
  // in code but donâ€™t want the output string to contain newline characters,
  // then you can surround each line with single quotes:

  const bigString2 = 'This is only'
  'a single line '
  'at '
  'runtime.';
  print(bigString2); // Output: This is only a single line at runtime.
