void main() {
// In your dart code, you can give a name to each piece of your data that you
// you can refer later.
//The name carries with it an associated type that denotes what sort of data
// that name refers to, such number, text, or a date.

// Variable
// A variable works like a container that contains data and its type. It is
// known as variable because its value can be changed. For example:

  int number = 10; // now the number contains 10
  number = 15;   // but now, same number contains 15.
  print (number);

  // The type int. stores Integer data.
  // to store decimal data we use 'double' data type. For Example:

  double cgpa = 3.5;
  print("My CGPA is ${cgpa} in the final semester");

  // One interesting example
  print(10.isEven); // Can you tell what will be the output? 
}
